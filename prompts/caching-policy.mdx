# Caching Policy

The Basalt SDK implements a two-level caching strategy to optimize performance and ensure high availability of your prompts.

## Caching Architecture

Basalt employs a dual-layer caching system:

1. **API Cache**: Our backend maintains a distributed cache to ensure high availability and reliability, even during service disruptions.

2. **SDK Local Cache**: The SDK includes a built-in local cache that stores recently retrieved prompts to minimize network requests and improve response times.

## Default Behavior

By default, the SDK's local cache is **enabled** with a **5-minute duration**. This means:

- Repeated requests for the same prompt within a 5-minute window will be served from the local cache
- After 5 minutes, the cache entry expires and a new request to the API will be made
- The API may still serve a cached response if the prompt didn't change in the meantime

## Disabling Cache

You can disable the local SDK cache for specific requests when you need the most up-to-date version of a prompt:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Disable caching for a specific get request
const { value } = await basalt.prompt.get('welcome-message', {
  cache: false
})
```

```python Python
# Disable caching for a specific get request
error, value = basalt.prompt.get(
    'welcome-message',
    cache=False
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
The local cache is currently available only on the `get` method. On the method `list` and `describe`, the API cache is entirely managing the requests.
</Info>

## Best Practices

Here are some recommendations for effectively using the caching system:

1. **Production Environments**: Keep caching enabled in production to maximize performance and reduce API calls.

2. **Development Environments**: Consider disabling caching during development to ensure you're always working with the latest prompt versions:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// In development environments, globally disable caching
const basalt = new BasaltSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  cacheEnabled: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development'
})
```

```python Python
# In development environments, globally disable caching
is_dev = os.environ.get('ENVIRONMENT') == 'development'
basalt = BasaltSDK(
    api_key='your-api-key',
    cache_enabled=not is_dev
)
```
</CodeGroup>

3. **Time-Sensitive Operations**: Disable caching for operations where having the absolute latest version is critical.

4. **Burst Operations**: Keep caching enabled when making many requests in a short period to avoid rate limiting.

## Global Cache Configuration

You can configure global caching behavior when initializing the SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Disable caching globally
const basalt = new BasaltSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  cacheEnabled: false
})

// Or customize cache duration (in milliseconds)
const basalt = new BasaltSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  cacheDuration: 60000 // 1 minute
})
```

```python Python
# Disable caching globally
basalt = BasaltSDK(
    api_key='your-api-key',
    cache_enabled=False
)

# Or customize cache duration (in seconds)
basalt = BasaltSDK(
    api_key='your-api-key',
    cache_duration=60  # 1 minute
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Cache Invalidation

The SDK automatically handles cache invalidation in the following scenarios:

1. When the cache duration expires (default: 5 minutes)
2. When explicitly requested with `cache: false`
3. When using the API to update or modify prompts (the API invalidates relevant cache entries)

For manual cache control, you can use the cache management methods:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Clear the entire cache
await basalt.cache.clear()

// Clear cache for a specific prompt
await basalt.cache.invalidate('prompt', 'welcome-message')

// Clear cache for a prompt category
await basalt.cache.invalidate('feature', 'onboarding')
```

```python Python
# Clear the entire cache
basalt.cache.clear()

# Clear cache for a specific prompt
basalt.cache.invalidate('prompt', 'welcome-message')

# Clear cache for a prompt category
basalt.cache.invalidate('feature', 'onboarding')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Benefits of Caching

Utilizing the SDK's caching system provides several advantages:

- **Improved Performance**: Reduced latency for frequently accessed prompts
- **Reduced API Costs**: Fewer API calls means lower operational costs
- **Network Resilience**: Ability to serve cached content during network disruptions
- **Reduced Load**: Less strain on your application and our API servers

## When Not to Use Caching

While caching is beneficial in most scenarios, consider disabling it in these cases:

- During active prompt development and testing
- For prompts that must always reflect the latest updates
- In CI/CD pipelines where reproducibility is essential
