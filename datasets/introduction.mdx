<Info>
  The Datasets is not yet available in the SDK. It is currently in development and will be available soon. This page provides a preview of what's coming.

  In the meantime, you can use the [Basalt App](https://app.getbasalt.ai) to create and manage datasets.

## What are Datasets?

Datasets in Basalt will provide a structured way to store, manage, and utilize collections of data for your AI workflows. This upcoming feature will enable you to:

- Store representative examples of your inputs and expected outputs
- Create standardized test sets for evaluating your AI systems
- Run experiments against consistent data
- Compare different approaches using the same baseline data

## Planned Capabilities

When the Datasets feature is released, you'll be able to:

### Push Data to Datasets

```typescript
// Add examples to your dataset
await basalt.datasets.add('customer-queries', [
  { input: 'How do I reset my password?', category: 'account' },
  { input: 'When will my order arrive?', category: 'orders' }
])
```

### Use Datasets in Experiments

```typescript
// Create an experiment
const experiment = await basalt.monitor.createExperiment('query-classification')

// Run your workflow against a dataset
await basalt.datasets.runExperiment({
  datasetSlug: 'customer-queries',
  experiment: experiment,
  workflow: async (item) => {
    // Your workflow code here, using the dataset item
    return classifyQuery(item.input)
  }
})
```

### Retrieve Dataset Items

```typescript
// Get items from your dataset
const items = await basalt.datasets.get('customer-queries', {
  limit: 10,
  shuffle: true
})
```

## Benefits of Datasets

The upcoming Datasets feature will help you:

- **Ensure Consistency**: Test on the same data over time
- **Improve Reproducibility**: Get reliable comparisons between different approaches
- **Streamline Testing**: Automate experimentation with real-world examples
- **Track Progress**: Measure improvements against a consistent benchmark

## Stay Tuned

We're excited to bring Datasets to Basalt soon! This feature will complement our existing monitoring and experimentation capabilities, creating a more comprehensive platform for developing, testing, and optimizing your AI applications.
