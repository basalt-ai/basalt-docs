# Observability

Basalt v1 introduces a unified, OpenTelemetry-based observability system for AI applications. This is a major breaking change from v0, with new APIs, context propagation, and auto-instrumentation for LLMs, vector DBs, and frameworks.

<Info>
This section covers the core concepts and breaking changes in v1 observability. For SDK usage, see the Python or TypeScript tabs.

## What's New in v1?
- Unified `observe`/`start_observe` API for tracing, logging, and context
- Full OpenTelemetry compatibility and context propagation
- Auto-instrumentation for LLMs, vector DBs, and frameworks
- Rich identity, experiment, and evaluator tracking
- Async and sync support with identical APIs
- Major API changes: see migration notes in the Python tab

> **Migration:** v1 is not backward compatible with v0. See the Python tab for migration guidance and code examples.
