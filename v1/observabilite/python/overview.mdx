# Overview

Basalt v1 observability is built on OpenTelemetry and introduces a unified API for tracing, logging, and context propagation. This page covers the new concepts, migration notes, and best practices for Python users.

## Major v1 Changes
- Unified `observe`/`start_observe` API for all tracing and logging
- Full support for OpenTelemetry context propagation
- Auto-instrumentation for LLMs, vector DBs, and frameworks
- Rich identity, experiment, and evaluator tracking
- Async and sync support with identical APIs

## Migration from v0
- v1 is **not backward compatible** with v0
- All tracing, logging, and context APIs have changed
- See the Examples and API Reference tabs for new usage patterns

## Core Concepts
- **Root Spans:** Use `start_observe` (or `async_start_observe`) for entry points
- **Nested Spans:** Use `observe` (or `async_observe`) for child operations
- **Identity & Experiment:** Attach user/org/experiment to root spans; propagates automatically
- **Evaluators:** Attach evaluators to spans for automated grading
- **Auto-Instrumentation:** Enable tracing for LLMs, DBs, frameworks with zero code

See the Examples tab for practical code and the API Reference for details.
