## What are Experiments?

Experiments in Basalt are a mechanism for:
- Tracking variants of prompts, models, or approaches
- Comparing performance across versions
- Associating traces with experiments
- Attaching metadata to observability spans

## Core Concepts

### Experiment Model

```python
@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)
class Experiment:
    id: str                 # Unique identifier
    name: str               # Human-readable name
    feature_slug: str       # Feature slug
    created_at: str         # ISO 8601 timestamp
```

### TraceExperiment

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class TraceExperiment:
    id: str                      # Experiment ID
    name: str | None = None      # Optional display name
    feature_slug: str | None = None  # Optional feature slug
```
