# Overview

This page explains how to use Basalt's Experiments API with Python. Experiments help you organize, track, and compare different approaches in your AI workflows.

<Warning>
This documentation is for the Python SDK. For TypeScript, see the TypeScript tab.

## Installation

Ensure you have the Basalt SDK installed:

```bash
pip install basalt-sdk
```

## Client Initialization

You can interact with experiments using the `ExperimentsClient`.

```python
from basalt.experiments import ExperimentsClient

client = ExperimentsClient(api_key="your-api-key")
```

## Creating Experiments

You can create experiments programmatically to register new tests or variants.

### Synchronous Creation

```python
experiment = client.create_sync(
    feature_slug="llm-routing",
    name="Model Selection Experiment"
)

print(f"Created experiment: {experiment.id}")
```

### Asynchronous Creation

```python
import asyncio

async def create_experiment():
    experiment = await client.create(
        feature_slug="llm-routing",
        name="Model Selection Experiment"
    )
    return experiment

asyncio.run(create_experiment())
```

## Using Experiments with Observability

The most common use case is attaching an experiment context to your traces. This allows you to slice and dice your observability data by experiment.

```python
from basalt.observability import start_observe, observe

@start_observe(
    feature_slug="ab-test",
    name="experiment.variant_a",
    experiment="exp-456", # The ID of the experiment
    identity={
        "organization": {"id": "123", "name": "ACME"},
        "user": {"id": "456", "name": "John Doe"}
    }
)
def run_variant_a():
    # Experiment metadata is automatically attached to the root span
    observe.set_input({"variant": "A", "model": "gpt-4o"})
    
    # ... your logic ...
    
    return "result"
```
