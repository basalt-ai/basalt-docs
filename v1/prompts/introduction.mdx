# Prompts Management

Basalt's Prompts API provides version control, tag-based deployment, and dynamic variable substitution for your AI prompts. This guide covers all prompt operations with complete examples.

## Overview

The Prompts API enables you to:
- **Store prompts centrally** with version control
- **Deploy prompts** using tags (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `latest`)
- **Substitute variables** dynamically using Jinja2 templates
- **Cache prompts** for performance with graceful fallback
- **Manage model configurations** alongside prompts
