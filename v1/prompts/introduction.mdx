# What are prompts?

In Basalt, a **prompt** is a reusable, versioned template that describes how your AI should behave in a given context.

Instead of hard‑coding strings like "You are a support bot…" all over your codebase, you define prompts once in Basalt, give them a stable slug, and reference them from your applications via the SDK or API.

A prompt typically combines:

- **System behavior** – role, tone, and constraints (e.g. “You are a senior support agent…”)
- **Task instructions** – what the model should do (e.g. “Summarize this ticket in 3 bullet points…”)
- **Examples** – optional few-shot examples to steer behavior
- **Variables** – placeholders like `{{customer_message}}` filled at runtime
- **Model configuration** – provider, model name, and parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)

Prompts become first-class, shareable building blocks you can reuse across:

- User-facing features (assistants, copilots, search, recommendations)
- Internal tools (support, operations, data quality checks)
- Background workflows (cron jobs, pipelines, agents)

## Prompts Management

Basalt’s Prompts API lets you manage these templates like code:

- Prompts are **versioned** so you always know what is running.
- You **deploy** versions to environments using **tags** (for example `production`, `staging`, `latest`).
- You can evolve prompts safely over time while keeping older versions available for rollback or comparison.

With the Prompts API you can:

- **Create and update prompts** as your product or use cases evolve
- **Track versions** to understand which behavior is live in each environment
- **Deploy using tags** instead of hard-coding version numbers in your application
- **Roll out changes gradually** by pointing different services or environments at different tags
- **Attach model settings** directly to prompts so configuration travels with the template

## Overview

At a high level, the Prompts API enables you to:

- **Store prompts centrally** with full version history
- **Deploy prompts with tags** (e.g. `production`, `staging`, `latest`)
- **Substitute variables dynamically** using Jinja2 templates
- **Cache prompts for performance** with graceful fallback
- **Manage model configurations** alongside prompt content

In the rest of this section you’ll see:

- How to **define** prompts and variables in Basalt
- How to **fetch** prompts from the SDK by slug, tag, or version
- How to **safely update and roll back** prompts with versioning
- How to **test and iterate** on prompt changes without risking production
