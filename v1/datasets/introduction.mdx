# Datasets

Basalt's Datasets API helps you organize test data for evaluating AI model outputs. Store inputs, expected outputs, and metadata to systematically test and improve your AI applications.

Datasets enable you to:
- **Organize test cases** with structured inputs and expected outputs
- **Store ideal outputs** for automated quality evaluation
- **Track metadata** for additional context on each test case
- **Integrate with evaluators** for quality monitoring
